# JavaCodeWars
Scratch work files for solving Code Wars projects

CodeWars is website that I use to stay sharp and practice in Swift, Java, and C#.

This folder contains a workspace with a few examples of tasks from that website.

The examples here will all be in Java.

The folder can be directly downloaded and upened.
